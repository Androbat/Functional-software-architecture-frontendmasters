// What is a monad?
// A monad is a design pattern to:
// * Manage state
// * Manage side effects
// * Manage async code
// * Manage null values
// * Manage exceptions

// Thinking Inside the Box â€” Maybe Monad
// We can think of a Monad as a box, meaning we can take a value and insert it inside a box known as Just.
// In a case where there is no value, it is represented by an empty Box known as Nothing.
// We can then create a Maybe that can take the form of either Just or Nothing.

// One of the outstanding features of Monads is their composability, 
// and we can achieve it by using a special function known as bind 
// (which might also be referred to as flatMap or chain).

// bind enables us to take a function, 
// apply it to the Monad, and receive a new Monad in return.
